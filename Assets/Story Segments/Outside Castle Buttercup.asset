  storyText: "Outside Castle Buttercup\r\n\r\nMedieval times\r\n\r\nYou, the great
    warrior, Bernard, stand before the Castle Buttercup.  You have come here to rescue
    Princess Luscious who is locked away in the castle tower.  She was kidnapped
    by the evil King Buttercup \u2013 some grievance over being teased when he was
    a child in school.  Hey, his last name is BUTTERCUP.  You were not going to just
    let that slide! \r\n\r\nKing Buttercup and his guards are no match against the
    strength and agility of a great warrior such as yourself.  Actually, you are
    quite near sighted and have no eye / hand coordination whatsoever.  But, you
    are not about to let that keep you from saving your beloved, your honey bunch,
    your main squeeze, your love bunny\u2026you get the idea.  She is REALLY curvy
    too!\r\n\r\nThe castle is surrounded by a moat.  A drawbridge stands before you
    leading across the moat to the castle entrance. \r\n\r\nWhat do you, the great
    warrior, Bernard, do next?\r\n\r\nPress 1 to employ stealth and swim across the
    moat\r\n\r\nPress 2 to boldly charge across the drawbridge"
