  storyText: "Drawbridge\r\n\r\nAs soon as you step onto the drawbridge, dozens of
    horrific creatures with menacing, grotesque claws, large, razor sharp teeth and
    wings to give them flight appear before you.  Normally, this would be a show
    stopper.  However, you know these creatures are the creation of the wicked witch
    Gertrude who is in league with the evil King Buttercup.  You also know all of
    wicked witch Gertrude\u2019s creatures melt away when exposed to water.  And,
    there just happens to be five gallon buckets of water lining each side of the
    drawbridge at five foot intervals from one end of the drawbridge to the other.
    \r\n\r\nSeriously, what are the chances of that?  It is almost as if this were
    a convenient plot device in some fictional tale.  Nah!  That\u2019s crazy talk!
    \r\n\r\nYou march across the drawbridge laying waste to the hideous creatures
    with buckets of water as you go. You reach the end of the drawbridge.\r\n\r\nPress
    1 to enter the castle"
