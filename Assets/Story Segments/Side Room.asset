    servants wearing nothing but their skivvies engaged in a ferocious food fight. 
    Food is flying everywhere! \r\n\r\nUpon your entrance, the food fight comes to
    a screeching halt and all of the servants turn to stare at you. \r\n\r\nThis
    is awkward. \r\n\r\nYou make your excuses and slowly back out of the room closing
    the door quietly behind you. You can hear the sounds of the food fight continuing
    on the other side of the closed door.\r\n\r\nWow!.......Just.......Wow!\r\n\r\nDid
    they say \u201Cwow!\u201D in medieval times? Moving on.\r\n\r\nPress 1 to return
    to the grand entrance\r\n\r\nDoor To Castle Tower:\r\n\r\nDoor to Castle Tower\r\n\r\nYou
    climb the staircase.  At top of the stairs, you face a large, very solid looking
    door.  The door is locked.  To the right of the door, a key hangs on a hook.\r\n\r\nPress
    1 to break the door down using your brute strength \r\n\r\nPress 2 to unlock
    the door using the key hanging on the hook"
